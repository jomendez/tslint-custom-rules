# tslint-custom-rules


Set of TSLint custom rules, implemented unit testing.

Find the tests files in `./test` folder (the `.spec`), change the rues on the `/src` folder, and then run `npm test` to check everything is as expected.

After your rule is ready you can compile it using `npm run build`, and use the results in the `dist` folder.
